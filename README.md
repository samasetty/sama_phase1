# 6.1100 Decaf Compiler Java Skeleton

In this repo you will find a skeleton for the Decaf compiler project. You may organize this project in any way you see fit as long as the ``build.sh`` and `run.sh` files build and run your compiler respectively.

This skeleton uses Gradle by default with Kotlin DSL. We highly recommend writing your own tests in addition to the ones provided.

Please ensure you are using your installed Java version is at least 17. If you have multiple JDKs installed on your machine, make sure you set the ``JAVA_HOME`` environmental variable.

Happy compiler-building!
